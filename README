VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

        use API::Name;
    
        my $name = API::Name->new(
            apiuser    => 'APIUSER',
            apitoken   => 'APITOKEN',
            identifier => 'APPLICATION NAME',
        );
    
        $name->debug(1);
        $name->fatal(1);
    
        my $domain = $name->domains(get => 'example.com');
        my $results = $domain->fetch;
    
        # after some introspection
    
        $domain->update( ... );

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides an object-oriented thin-client library for
    interacting with the Name (https://www.name.com) API. For usage and
    documentation information visit
    https://www.name.com/reseller/API-documentation.

THIN CLIENT

    A thin-client library is advantageous as it has complete API coverage
    and can easily adapt to changes in the API with minimal effort. As a
    thin-client library, this module does not map specific HTTP requests to
    specific routines, nor does it provide parameter validation,
    pagination, or other conventions found in typical API client
    implementations, instead, it simply provides a simple and consistent
    mechanism for dynamically generating HTTP requests. Additionally, this
    module has support for debugging and retrying API calls as well as
    throwing exceptions when 4xx and 5xx server response codes are
    returned.

 Building

        my $domain = $name->domains(get => 'example.com');
    
        $domain->action; # GET /domains/get/example.com
        $domain->action('head'); # HEAD /domains/get/example.com
        $domain->action('patch'); # PATCH /domains/get/example.com

    Building up an HTTP request object is extremely easy, simply call
    method names which correspond to the API's path segments in the
    resource you wish to execute a request against. This module uses
    autoloading and returns a new instance with each method call. The
    following is the equivalent:

 Chaining

        my $domain = $name->resource('domains', 'get', 'example.com');
    
        # or
    
        my $domains = $name->domains;
        my $domain  = $domains->resource('get', 'example.com');
    
        # then
    
        $domain->action('put', %args); # PUT /domains/get/example.com

    Because each call returns a new API instance configured with a resource
    locator based on the supplied parameters, reuse and request isolation
    are made simple, i.e., you will only need to configure the client once
    in your application.

 Fetching

        my $domains = $name->domains;
    
        # query-string parameters
    
        $domains->fetch( query => { ... } );
    
        # equivalent to
    
        my $domains = $name->resource('domains');
    
        $domains->action( get => ( query => { ... } ) );

    This example illustrates how you might fetch an API resource.

 Creating

        my $domains = $name->domains;
    
        # content-body parameters
    
        $domains->create( data => { ... } );
    
        # query-string parameters
    
        $domains->create( query => { ... } );
    
        # equivalent to
    
        $name->resource('domains')->action(
            post => ( query => { ... }, data => { ... } )
        );

    This example illustrates how you might create a new API resource.

 Updating

        my $domains = $name->domains;
        my $domain  = $domains->resource('get', 'example.com');
    
        # content-body parameters
    
        $domain->update( data => { ... } );
    
        # query-string parameters
    
        $domain->update( query => { ... } );
    
        # or
    
        my $domain = $name->domains('get', 'example.com');
    
        $domain->update(...);
    
        # equivalent to
    
        $name->resource('domains')->action(
            put => ( query => { ... }, data => { ... } )
        );

    This example illustrates how you might update a new API resource.

 Deleting

        my $domains = $name->domains;
        my $domain  = $domains->resource('get', 'example.com');
    
        # content-body parameters
    
        $domain->delete( data => { ... } );
    
        # query-string parameters
    
        $domain->delete( query => { ... } );
    
        # or
    
        my $domain = $name->domains('get', 'example.com');
    
        $domain->delete(...);
    
        # equivalent to
    
        $name->resource('domains')->action(
            delete => ( query => { ... }, data => { ... } )
        );

    This example illustrates how you might delete an API resource.

 Transacting

        my $domains = $name->resource('domains', 'get', 'example.com');
    
        my ($results, $transaction) = $domains->action( ... );
    
        my $request  = $transaction->req;
        my $response = $transaction->res;
    
        my $headers;
    
        $headers = $request->headers;
        $headers = $response->headers;
    
        # etc

    This example illustrates how you can access the transaction object used
    represent and process the HTTP transaction.
